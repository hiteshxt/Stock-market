# Simple Stock Price Predictor with PyTorch

This repository contains a basic Python script that attempts to predict stock prices using a linear regression model implemented in PyTorch. **Please read this README carefully before using the code.**

## Disclaimer

**This code is for educational purposes only. It is NOT intended for use in making real-world investment decisions. The accuracy of the predictions is limited, and no guarantees of financial profit or loss prevention are made. Investing in the stock market involves risk, and you should always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment choices.**

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a very basic application of machine learning for predicting stock prices. It uses a linear regression model trained on historical stock closing prices and does *not* incorporate advanced machine learning techniques. The model's ability to accurately forecast real stock market movements is highly limited due to the many factors not taken into account by this simplified model.

## How the Code Works

The script performs the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** It reads stock data from a `.csv` file (expected format described below).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** It shifts the closing price by one day to create the input feature, preparing the data for a supervised learning task.
3.  **Data Splitting:** The data is split into training and
